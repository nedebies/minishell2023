# minishell

The goal of this group-of-two project is to create a shell command similar to the bash-3.2

This project has been led to success with [Merlin Bougeois](https://github.com/MerlinBourgeois) who dealed with the parsing and builtins part.
On my side, I focused on the multi-processes and executable part.
